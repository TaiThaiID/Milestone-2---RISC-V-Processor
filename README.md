# Milestone-2---RISC-V-Processor
In this milestone, students are tasked with designing a single-cycle RV32I processor, as discussed in lectures. The processor is implemented with the ISA RV32I, excluding FENCE instructions. To enable communication between your custom processor (soft-core) and external peripherals, some modifications to the standard processor design are necessary
